### What is the role of the media coverage in explaining stock market fluctuations ?

## How does the media coverage of Apple evolve over time ?

Thousands of events occur around the world every day, and humans notice only a small subset of these events. Yet, the media attract attention to specific events. In this regard, a company’s media visibility will definitely affect its stock price. Are there any specific patterns we can observe across the years, for instance bigger media coverage when there is the keynote ? 

Let's investigate the relationships between the fluctuations of the stock market of Apple and the media coverage related to this company for a period of 12 years (2008–2020).

We can already make a few interesting observations.
First, we see that there is a strong correlation in multiple groups regarding fibre, protein, alcohol, and sugar consumption.
Additionally we observe a divergence concerning the nutrient diversity.
We can conjoin this information with further analyses regarding median household income, and the number of inhabitants with the highest degree being a secondary school degree (Level 2) or an academic degree (Level 4+).
Especially the high distinctiveness between the latter two concerning carbohydrate and sugar consumption, nutrient diversity, and alcohol consumption.
*"Intelligentsia bibent", as my Latin teacher would say*.
Another interesting observation is the high correlation between fibre and alcohol consumption and area wealth.


Combining the former observations, we can look into an area's alcohol consumption in a joint relation of its inhabitants' wealth and ethnic make-up.
We observe a clear trend, most strongly in cases where both attributes increase jointly.

Something interesting in this context is that we can divide alcohol consumption into the different categories of alcoholic products, that is, into wine and spirits.
We can see that the "summit line" previously observed for general alcohol consumption appears anew when observing wine consumption, while the pattern is nearly inverted with respect to spirit consumption.
