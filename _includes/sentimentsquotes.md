### Can We Go Deeper?

## What is the influence of the public opinions or emotions about Apple expressed in the media on the stock market ?

Media influences beliefs by providing compelling information about events. In this regard, the media have been identified to play a significant role in shaping the consensus market opinion. Can a series of news articles make a stock rise? On the other hand, can it send a market into turmoil ? We hypothesize that emotions of the public in the media about a company would reflect in its stock price. Indeed, positive news about Apple would encourage people to invest in the stocks of the company. On the other hand, increases in expressions of anxiety, worry and fear would predict downward pressure on the stocks of the company. Understanding the author's opinion from a piece of text is the objective of sentiment analysis. We classify quotes as positive, negative and neutral based on the sentiment present. We want to answer the following questions : are the stock price drops/rises correlated with negative/positive quotes ?
