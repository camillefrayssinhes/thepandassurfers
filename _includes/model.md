## How rich would you get if you developed a way to accurately predict the stock market?

### The holy grail of day tradersâ€¦ building a model for stock market prediction

After the basic analysis, we attempt to train a machine learning model to predict the daily stock price using the quotes related to Apple, speakers data and past stock performance. The model is a modular linear regression model, that can take into account past performance and additional factors. The model is trained on data from 2015 to 2017 and predict the daily stock price in 2018.
The resulting regression model did not perform well to predict the stock price during the first semester of 2018. However, it is quite effective in predicting the stock price during the last semester of 2018. Especially, it has well predicted the little drop in the stock price in June 2018!
