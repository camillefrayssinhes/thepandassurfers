## Who are the individuals who have influence over potential customers, and do these influencers have an impact on the Apple company image and eventually, on the stock market ?


We have looked at the influence of the author’s opinion from the different quotes of our data set on the stock market. But yet, we still miss an important piece of information. Indeed, if the previous president of the United States Donald Trump shares his opinion about Apple and if a random postman shares his opinion, it won't likely have the same effect. Thus: what is the impact of the speaker on the stock market? The response is relatively simple, it depends on how well known the speaker was at the time he or she was quoted in the media. And a quite simple way to have that indicators is the number of pageviews on then speakers' Wikipedia page (if there is one !).

The reason why we look at the fame of the speaker is that personality plays a huge role in consumer buying behavior. Indeed, the high level of public attention and the positive emotional responses that define celebrity increase the economic opportunities available to a firm. We hypothesize that quotes from celebrities significantly impact the stock market, whereas quotes from ordinary people have no significant predictive power. One defining characteristic of a celebrity is that it is a social actor who attracts large-scale public attention : the greater the number of people who know of and pay attention to the actor, the greater the extent and value of that celebrity.

As an important next step to explore the impact of the speaker fame on the stock market, we need to subdivide the speakers into classes based on how much this person is notorious. 

To achieve this, we use Wikipedia that has almost one page for every famous person. This allows us to identify the most similar sub-groupings of the speakers based on their Wikipedia page view statistics. We identified three different groupings for the different speakers : "**poorly influential**", "**moderately influential**", "**highly influential**". [CHANGER CAR C'EST UN SCORE QUI EST DONNÉ]
