## Who are the individuals who have influence over potential customers, and do these influencers have an impact on the Apple company image and eventually, on the stock market ?

Personality plays a huge role in consumer buying behavior. Indeed, the high level of public attention and the positive emotional responses that define celebrity increase the economic opportunities available to a firm. We hypothesize that quotes from celebrities significantly impact the stock market, whereas quotes from ordinary people have no significant predictive power. One defining characteristic of a celebrity is that it is a social actor who attracts large-scale public attention : the greater the number of people who know of and pay attention to the actor, the greater the extent and value of that celebrity.

As an important next step to explore the impact of the speaker fame on the stock market, we need to subdivide the speakers into classes based on how much this person is notorious. 

To achieve this, we use Wikipedia that has almost one page for every famous person. This allows us to identify the most similar sub-groupings of the speakers based on their Wikipedia page view statistics. We identified three different groupings for the different speakers : "*poorly influential*", "*moderately influential*", "*highly influential*". [Ã€ VOIR SI ON FAIT 2 CLASSES OU 3]
