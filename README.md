### Web and theme Engine: 
On top of the Github Pages framework we use the Jekyll engine, which is a flexible and accessible static website engine. It allowed us to easily write our report into a markdown file, import the figures generated in html by plotly and customize the design as we liked.

Furthermore Jekyll supports not only a variety of Jekyll ready themes, but also any modern HTML5 themes. We used the *Story* theme provided by [HTML5UP](https://html5up.net/story), that we then converted to a supported Jekyll theme. This theme provide a wide range of sections, widgets and buttons that made customization easy.

### Content and figures

Jekyll natively supports markdown files as the primary source of content. The full text and story is contained in ```index.md```, which is a standard handwritten markdown file. The plotly figures are already rendered and imported from ```_includes/```.
